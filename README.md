# VersionMirrorer

A tool which downloads every single version from the official launcher's list. Checks for new ones every 10 seconds. Can capture pre-reuploads and reuploads of a given version.

Can now monitor Mojira JE versions (so we can get even more accurate release times and predict the future)

Usage:
launch the jar by using java -jar VersionMirrorer-v1.0.4.jar command.
It's gonna mirror every version at the first run, so be patient.
